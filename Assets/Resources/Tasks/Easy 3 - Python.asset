  _taskDescription: 'You have a field 6x6. The walls are 1, the flag is 2 while 0
    is traversable.

    Player follow commands passed in actions parameter.

    Normally
    the player does not go into the wall when the actions says to.

    Our goal
    though is to create a cyberbug. Player must get stuck inside the walls instead
    of avoiding them.'
  _hint: 'Your player should not reach the flag. Instead he must be on the wall tiles
    or inside that square thing after the last action.

    Maybe once he is "touching
    a wall", he is on the wall tile forever and can''t leave.'
