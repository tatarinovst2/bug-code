  _taskDescription: "According to the legend, AIs in Civilization had a parameter
    that described their aggression on a scale from 1 to 10. Indian leader Gandhi
    was the only leader with the lowest aggression rating of 1 and was only able
    to wage defensive wars. Once the AI changed its government form to democracy,
    its aggression level decreased by 2. In the case of Gandhi, this would lead to
    an aggression level of \u22121. The problem was that an unsigned integer storing
    values in the range from 0 to 255 lead to an integer underflow. The result was
    255 aggression.\n\nReproduce the bug. You are given what methods to write.\n\nInterface
